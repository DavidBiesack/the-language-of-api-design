## Domain model

(The application or solution domain that your software product will improve)

A social media app in which fan fiction authors can compose content, mix other authors' existing content in new ways,
to author and share new stories or continue existing story lines.
Each story exists within a story universe. Characters (of various species) can span universes and have roles in many stories.

## Context

(Defining a context helps put boundaries around the problem and the solution: what is in scope, what we ignore.)

Reading, authoring, and sharing fan fiction stories.

Out of scope for now:

* Content moderation, plagairization detection, content safety ratings, banning authors
* Flexible copyright management: all authors must consent to a single Creative Commons non-commercial copyright
* Copyright infringement controls: authors agree to only contribute original work, not other's copyrighted work.
* Monetization: authors cannot put up paywalls to access their content, or sell other's work
* Star rating systems on content
* ... What other scope limitations can ew impose to narrow the context of the solution?

## Resources

(The "entities" or “things” in the domain.)

1. Stories, a.k.a. story lines. For this product, stories are called "chains" (branding name).
2. Story elements - reusable content that may be added to other stories. 
   For this product, story elements are called "chain links" (branding name).
   Chain links may be strung together to create chains.
   Chain links may be plain text, rich text, images, audio, video
4. Authors
5. ... What other resources do you see? (Hint: view the scenario and list the key nouns.)

## Traits
        
(A list of reusable characteristics or attributes that apply to this domain’s resources and behaviors.)

1. 
2. 
3.

## Actors
   
(Someone or something that interacts with the system.)

1. Authors
2. ... What other actors can you identiy?

## Behavior
   
(The activity that an actor performs in the system when interacting with the resources. 
Behaviors are the business actions within our domain’s contexts—what the users do.)

## Constraint
   
(Conditions which put bounds on our context. Constraints can be large and small, such as a bound for our contexts,
a system invariant that is always true before, during, and after a behavior,
or a minimum/maximum value range of a property in a value object.)
